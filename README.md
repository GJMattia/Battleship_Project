Instructions:

- Start by adding your ships to your board using the Shipyard box!
- Click your favorite ship, rotate it if you want, enter in your desired coordinates and press `CONFIRM`!
- The game has offically begun, you and the computer will take alternating turns trying to find eachothers ships, once all 5 ships are sunk, we have a `WINNER`!

## Next Steps

Version 2.0:

- As a user I want to be able to click a button to randomize `my own` ships to start the game quicker.
- As a user I would like the computers ships to be more randomized.
- As a user I would like the game to be a bit harder.
- As a user I would like to see more animations on the screen.
